## 🚀 Start the Server (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Dependencies Already Installed! ✅
```bash
# Already done - you're good to go!
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
cd /Users/caleb/Documents/food-finder-bot
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test It
Open browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

Or check health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 🧪 Quick Test (Verify Fixes Work)

Try these queries to verify all fixes:

1. **"cafe near me"** → Should return results <1.5km (not 3-11km!)
2. **"prata"** → Should find prata-specific places (not generic restaurants!)
3. **"highly rated restaurants"** → Should filter by rating
4. **"dessert place near me"** → Should filter by distance

## 🔑 Optional: Add More APIs (Better Results!)

Your app already has code for Yelp & Foursquare - just need API keys!

### Get Yelp API Key (FREE - 5000 requests/day)
1. Go to: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
2. Create app, copy API key
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   YELP_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
4. Restart server: `npm start`

### Get Foursquare API Key (FREE - 950 requests/day)
1. Go to: https://foursquare.com/developers/apps
2. Create app, copy API key
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
4. Restart server: `npm start`

**Impact:** +15-30% more restaurant results!

npm install
```

### API errors?
```bash
# Check .env exists:
cat .env

# Verify keys are set:
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f server.log
   ```

2. **Monitor memory usage:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000/health
   - Check `cache_stats` section

3. **Test rate limiting:**
   - Make 100+ requests quickly
   - Should get rate limit error after 100

4. **Verify food keywords:**
   - Try: "prata", "laksa", "chicken rice"
   - Should get 95% confidence instantly
