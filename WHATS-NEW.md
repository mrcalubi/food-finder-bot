## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### No skeletons showing?
```bash
# Force reload browser:
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
```

### Still seeing 10 results?
```bash
# Server didn't reload, restart it:
pkill node
npm start
```

### Images broken?
```bash
# Check .env has Google API key:
cat .env | grep GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

### No "Why this?" chips?
```bash
# Test API directly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "cafe", "location": "Singapore"}' \
  | jq '.recommendations[0].why_factors'

# Should return: ["Open now", "1.2km away", "4.7⭐ rating"]
```
